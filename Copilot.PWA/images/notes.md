#
# This is a basic example of how to create a Progressive Web App (PWA) using Copilot.
# It includes a basic service worker and manifest file to make the app installable on mobile devices.
#
# To use this code, you will need to:
# 1. Create a new directory for your PWA project
# 2. Copy the files in this repository to your project directory
# 3. Run the following commands in your project directory to create a new git repository and commit the files:
#    git init
#    git add .
#    git commit -m "Initial commit"
# 4. Run the following command to start a local server and view your PWA in a web browser:
#    python -m http.server
# 5. Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view your PWA
# 6. Try adding your PWA to the home screen on your mobile device to see how it works as an installable app

#
# This is a basic PWA (Progressive Web App) that uses a service worker
# to cache the app shell and assets, and the manifest.json file to
# provide metadata about the app.
#
# The service worker is a JavaScript file that runs in the background
# and intercepts network requests to cache responses and serve them
# when offline. The manifest.json file is a JSON file that contains
# metadata about the app, such as the name, icons, and start URL.
#
# To use this PWA, you need to host it on a web server that supports
# HTTPS, because service workers require a secure connection. You can
# use a local server such as http-server or live-server to test the app
# locally, or deploy it to a hosting provider such as Netlify or Vercel.
#
# To install the required dependencies, run:
# npm install express
# npm install http-server
# npm install live-server
#
# To start the local server, run:
# node server.js
# http-server
# live-server
#
# To deploy the app to a hosting provider, follow the instructions
# provided by the provider. For example, you can deploy the app to
# Netlify by running:
# netlify init
# netlify deploy
